My name is Mikyla Zhang (Yufan), I am a grad student in applied statistics. I am taking this course to prepare for myself to take on a position as data analyst once I graduate. The type of data analysis problem that interest me would be classification and prediction. I am currently working on a capstone project that does stock return forecasting for thousands of stocks. In this problem it's essentially predictions over data and I plan on using deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural nets to tackle the problem. I also did a movie rating prediction problem in my undergrad and built a Naive Bayes model to classcify each movie users with their movie preferences so I also thought that was an intresting problem. Below is a picture of the raw data from the movie rating problem. It shows the movie ID and its features. 
(Sorry I enrolled the class after the deadline of this assignment, so this assignment is turned in late)
